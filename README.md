# heidihud
A custom TF2 hud based on the default and broeselhud_blue, with a few quality of life tweaks.

### Installation

Download the latest heidihud.zip file from the [release page](https://github.com/heidi666/heidihud/releases), 
and extract it to [wherever you installed Steam]\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom.
In my case, the path ends up being E:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\heidihud.

Next open autoexec.cfg, which is in [wherever you installed Steam]\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\cfg. 
If you don't have this file, you'll need to create it. 

Make sure windows isn't hiding file extensions when you do this! 
Otherwise you'll end up with something like autoexec.cfg.txt, which won't work.

Paste the contents of my autoexec [here](https://github.com/heidi666/heidihud/blob/master/autoexec.cfg) into that file.

Profit!
